# My Codeforces Summer 2023 Analyses
This is my first trial to deal data analytics. I gathered data from the submissions with two questions in mind. First one was: is it better to solve early in the morning or in the noon or maybe at night? 
Whether it is better to solve in twos sessions per day or only one session? Results are in the readme. 

First of all, this summer I was focusing on its first part on aquiring the problem solving skill by participating in the ECPC, so I devoted time to solve problems almost daily on codeforces website. 
We solved four problems in the ecpc contest and did not qualify to the next step, we were only one problem away from the qualification. Alhamdullilah I also became pupil on codeforces in this month before the contest. 
..
The main problem of this project was: identifying the patterns that make solving more efficient. 
I believed it will be a good applicaion of the first course in google Data Analystics Certificati first course which was Data, Data, Everywhere.
Codeforces website provides really interesting data about the problems solved in the submissions part. 

In the second step needed data was identified, in data analyses process: PREPARE. For each day int the 40-day-periodthe following information was needed: when the first session started, and ended, 
same for second session, range of problems being solved, how many wrong answers I got befores solving all problems in this day, 
and how many accepted solutions I solved. Second step was over.

In the third step -which was: PROCESS, a threashold that makes a day good related to problems solving was set. It was solving more than 7 problems in this day. So new attributes were needed such as: Hours token to solve more than
7 problems in one session, Hours token to solve more than 7 problems in two sessions	Solved in one session, hours token in one session days,	AC's in it,	Hours token in two-session-day,	AC's in it2,	Total attempts, and	WA percentage.

Then we started the most important step, the 4th one: analyze. And after analyzing we reached the following conclusions: Every 6 times we solve in one session we only manage to solve more than 7 problems one time, but
Every 3 times we solve in two, we manage one time to solve more than 7 problems!
This proved to us that setting in two sessions is much better, double times better. check the graph.
And to answer the first question we asked the following question: What is the wrong answer percentage when solving starts at x hour. We reached that the best hours were 6 am, and 10 am.
Check the graph.

Fifth step is creating these graphs and sharing the infromation here for knowledge.

Sixth step goes to the reader: Try to solve early in the mourning, and solve problems in more than one session.
